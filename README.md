# MongoDB Python Shell

The new Mongo Shell ´mongosh´ is... weird...mostly because its
JavaScript.

Python being also a dynamic language that also support a very similar
object notation but more strict with types, may be a good candidate for
an alternate shell.

This is an experiment to do so.

Install with `pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/alanreyesv-mongodb-experiments/mongopysh.git
```

Also compatible and recomended to use [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

```
pipx install git+https://github.com/alanreyesv-mongodb-experiments/mongopysh.git
```
