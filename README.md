# MongoDB Python Shell

The new Mongo Shell (mongosh) is... weird...mostly because its
JavaScript.

Python being also a dynamic language that also support a very similar
object notation but more strict with types, may be a good candidate for
an alternate shell.

This is an experiment to do so.

Install with:


```bash
pip install git+http://..path..to..repo
```

(Also compatible and recoomended to use `pipx`)
